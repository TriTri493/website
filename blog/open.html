    <p>over the lockdown i played several games, mostly including<br>
    Minecraft, Infamous second son, need for speed and Red dead redemption 2.<br>
    and i noticed something, all these games being open world games, have one main thing in common.<br>
    they try, so god damn hard, not to end.<br>
    now you might be wondering, "oh but james, these are just games that have endess tasks!<br>
    i thought this too but realised, these tasks are almost the exact same.<br>
    this doesn't make me angry or want me to never play the game again, more just a pain<br>
    <br>
    red dead redemption is great, but once it finishes, you play as another charecter, which well, has tasks<br>
    the problem with this is that every one of these tasks is either apart of the story,<br>
    or a random encounter that turns into a robbery.<br>
    infamous second son isn't any different. once you beat the boss, no matter what path you take (good or bad)<br>
    you get basically the exact same thing as red dead, endless random battles<br>
    <br>
    now there's minecraft, holy shit there's minecraft<br>
    if you've played minecraft before, you'd know the simple aims<br>
    go mining, get iron, get diamonds, go to the nether, go to the end, beat the game<br>
    most people stop there, but nooo minecraft has achievements<br>
    some of these include farming, building, finding biomes and other bullshit to keep you playing<br>
    in reality, most players go to servers, this is why minecraft is good. it ends<br>
    so next time you play an Open world game, make sure to know that you'll spend at least 10 hours playing it<br>
