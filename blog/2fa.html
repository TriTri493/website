        <p>in 2017 i made my first discord account and had no clue what i was getting into. <br>
        being 14 at the time i had legit no idea of what kind of people i could meet on the internet. <br>

        turns out, being 14 taught me heaps of stuff:
        dont trust anyone you dont know, dont give out too much information, make friends but not too many friends.<br> 
        i still stick by these rules, i trust my ""online friends"" that i have a mutual respect with <br>
        although this story has an unfortunate ending. while trying to change a setting on Googles 2FA <br>
        service i found a problem and had this exact moment "hm, thats weird, discord has logged me out. <br>
        oh well, i'll sign in with the new temporary code feature." thissss wassssss not the case. <br>
        and so, i frantically emailed discord saying i have a problem. for the first day i got no reply, <br>
        just an email setting in my sent box doing nothing. the next day a guy named josh replied saying <br>
        and i quote "I'm so sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but unfortunately, we aren't able to remove <br>
        two-factor authentication from accounts due to security reasons, and the only way you'll be able to <br>
        regain access is if you saved the backup codes from inside Discord when you initially set up the two-factor<br>
        authentication. If you don't have access to these codes, then you'll have to create a new account." <br>
        this reply was both calming but also terrifying as my small 14 year old brain couldnt even think about <br>
        losing this 1 to 2 year old account with memories i didnt want to forget. <br>
            
        a while later, i realised that this was actually good. id made so many small fuck ups and met people i <br>
        shouldn't have which were now, all gone. which for my young little mind, was pretty empowering.<br>
            
            
        i know this message is weird and confusing but it tought me something i didnt expect to learn: <br>
        that sometimes to move on you have to leave what you may love behind.</p>
