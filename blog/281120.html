<p>
now that i have a 2 month long holiday, i have no clue what to do during it<br>
I'm gonna be watching tv with my family every night yes,<br>
but at the same time, i have no clue what i'm gonna do once i run out of movies to watch<br>
(unless i have a job soon which i'll probably get)<br>
also i'm gonna start making my own real coffee, with real coffee beans<br>
p exciting for this 17 yr old child<br>
also this project is alot of fun, and i thank you for reading this stupidly weird blog<br>
bless your kind brain
